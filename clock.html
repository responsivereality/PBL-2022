                The 3D Printed Clock is by far the biggest and most time consuming creation of this project. It was 3D printed, taking 48 hours in total to print and then another 3 hours to assemble. You read it by looking at the faces left to right denoting the hours, minutes and seconds respectively.
                <br><br>The clock works similarly to a grandfather clock, by having a weight pull down on the gears making them rotate. The pendulum then limits the rotations to one per second. It then uses gear ratios to make every full rotation that the second-hand makes one tick for the minute hand. Once the minute hand reaches 60, it flips back to 0 using a spiral shaped gear. Another gear ratio is then used to rotate the hour hand. This is the only print of this series that used any non 3D printed parts; it used bolts, washers and ball bearings, none of which can be 3D printed.
